                        <h2>About Me</h2>
                        <p>Howdy! I'm Walter Leinen, a former electrical apprentice and printmaker,
                            who is currently studying to be a Full Stack Engineer. I hope to complete
                            my certification by the end of September 2024 and enter the Coding Job Market.
                        </p>
                        <p>I have really enjoyed relearning HTML (I actually remember quite a bit from 
                            working on 1st wave iMacs in middle school) and CSS is very straight foward. 
                            I enjoy JavaScript the most so far, both in what it does for websites and 
                            the challenge of loops and iterators (I really liked my Logic and Proofs 
                            course in college.
                        </p>
                        <p>I think I bring good sense of graphic design and a contempary artisic eye to
                            any project, along with a working class drive to get results and accomplish goals
                            on schedule. As I develop my toolbox of skills with frontend and backend engineering,
                            I feel I will be a great employee for a number of coding companies.
                        </p>
                        <p>In my freetime I enjoy swimming at my local YWCA, taking in art exhibits at 
                            The Walker or MIA, and watching odd and critically acclaimed films at home or the theater.
                        </p>
